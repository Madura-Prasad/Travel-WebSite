                <p>The Photography Tour is specifically planned to take you to the destination's key attractions during the optimum periods of the year for photography. Sri Lanka, the Indian Ocean's jewel, provides photographers with rare opportunity to shoot the best of animals, culture, and environment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Itineraries can include historical landmarks, culture, people, nature, and adventure at a variety of locales around the island, including some of the most unusual yet intriguing areas.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We also aim to give you a taste of the local culture by taking you off the main path to see other local attractions. You'll also get the chance to meet and connect with other photographers, exchange advice, debate techniques, and learn how to better your photography overall.</p>
