                <h3>That's how you'll learn about the actual Sri Lanka and its people.</h3>
                <p>Trekking is a wonderful method to not only learn about Sri Lanka's people, customs, and culture, but also to explore the country. Rice paddies, rocky terrain, marshes, cloud forests, and mountain summits are all part of the trek. Take a look at some of the lesser-known archaeological sites. Along the trip, learn about the local culture and meet friendly locals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The routes run through dense woods, up steep slopes, through rushing waterfalls, amid tea farms, and across clear rivers that give a refreshing dip in the hill region, which offers some of the greatest topography and views.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition, the Cultural Triangle's trails allow hikers to get off the beaten route and find lesser-known temples, deserted forest, and archaeological ruins.</p>
